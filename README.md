# Random Quote Generator Using JavaScript

This random quote generator is created according to FCC challenge.
For this particular quote generator, vanilla JavaScript is used. The code is refactored based on project created in JQuery (you can find it in my repositories), which was created back in the day. Also, API url that is used for quotes is https://type.fit/api/quotes.
